## Breaking Changes

### `mode` and `strategy` removed from `AgentPlugin` options

The `mode: "auto" | "agent" | "silent"` and `strategy: "own" | "complement"` options on `AgentPlugin({})` are gone. They conflated two orthogonal axes: who is observing (human / agent / ci) and what they should see. Replace them with the new per-executor `console` matrix:

```ts
AgentPlugin({
  console: {
    human?: "passthrough" | "silent" | "ink" | "agent",
    agent?: "passthrough" | "silent" | "agent",
    ci?:    "passthrough" | "silent" | "ci-annotations",
  },
})
```

The plugin auto-detects the executor and looks up the matching slot. Per-slot defaults: `human` → `passthrough`, `agent` → `agent`, `ci` → `passthrough`. Any non-`passthrough` value strips Vitest's reporters so the plugin owns stdout. Debug an agent-style output in a human terminal by setting `console.human: "agent"`. Force silence on any slot with `silent`.

### `PluginMode` and `ConsoleStrategy` schemas removed from the SDK

The two literal-union schemas are gone. In their place: `HumanConsoleMode`, `AgentConsoleMode`, `CiConsoleMode`, and the umbrella `ConsoleMode` union (re-exported from `vitest-agent-sdk`).

### `ResolvedReporterConfig` shape change

The `mode` field on `kit.config` is replaced by `consoleMode: ConsoleMode` — the resolved value the plugin selected for the active executor. Custom reporter factories that switched on `kit.config.mode` need to switch on `kit.config.consoleMode` instead. New `githubSummary: boolean` field on the same struct, populated from the plugin's `githubSummary` option.

### `ExecutorResolver.resolve` signature simplified

The service's `resolve(env, mode)` becomes `resolve(env)`. Executor selection no longer takes a forcing mode — that decision moved into the per-executor console matrix.

## Features

### `vitest-agent-ui` — shared event-sourced renderer

A new workspace package owning the post-2.0 terminal-output stack. Re-exports the `RunEvent` discriminated union and `RenderState` projection from the SDK, ships the pure reducer, the markdown-flavored agent renderer (`renderAgent`), the React Ink component tree (`<App>`, `<RunSummary>`, `<ModuleHeader>`, `<TestRow>`, `<ModuleRow>`, `<FailureSection>`, `<CoverageBlock>`, `<SuggestedActions>`, `<StatusIcon>`), an Effect `PubSub` channel for live event transport, two synthesizers (`synthesizeRunEvents` for live Vitest module data, `synthesizeFromAgentReport` for persisted reports), a `renderRun` one-shot helper, the `eventSourcedReporter` factory implementing `VitestAgentReporterFactory`, and `createLiveInk` for long-running Ink mounts driven by streaming events.

Three public consumer surfaces:

```ts
import { renderRun, eventSourcedReporter, createLiveInk } from "vitest-agent-ui";
```

- `renderRun(events, mode, options)` — synchronous one-shot. Used by the CLI `show` command and any host that wants a final-frame string.
- `eventSourcedReporter` — `VitestAgentReporterFactory` for the plugin's `reporter` option. Emits one `RenderedOutput` per project in `agent` mode; emits `[]` in `ink`, `silent`, `passthrough`, and `ci-annotations` modes (other channels own the visible work).
- `createLiveInk()` — long-running orchestration handle with `event(e)` / `unmount()` / `snapshot()`. Wire as the plugin's `onRunEvent` tap to get a live Ink mount that redraws as test events arrive.

React and Ink are peer dependencies.

### Streaming reporter hooks + `onRunEvent` tap

`AgentReporter` now implements the Vitest streaming hooks (`onTestRunStart`, `onTestModuleQueued`, `onTestModuleStart`, `onTestCaseResult`, `onTestModuleEnd`) alongside the existing `onInit` / `onCoverage` / `onTestRunEnd` trio. Each callback constructs a typed `RunEvent` and fires the new `AgentReporterConstructorOptions.onRunEvent` tap. `onTestRunEnd` emits `RunFinished` at the top of the persistence pipeline so live subscribers see end-of-run before persistence runs. Throwing taps are caught and logged to stderr — persistence never breaks because a live renderer has a bug.

`AgentPlugin` exposes the same tap via its `onRunEvent` option. The plugin forwards events only when the resolved `consoleMode === "ink"`; other modes suppress the tap so a live Ink mount cannot leak into channels the user explicitly opted out of.

### `vitest-agent show` CLI command

A new read-only command renders the latest cached run for a project through the shared event-sourced renderer:

```bash
vitest-agent show --project my-pkg --format auto|agent|human|json [--width 80]
```

`auto` picks `human` (Ink `renderToString`) when stdout is a TTY and `agent` (markdown final frame) otherwise. The implementation routes through `DataReader.getLatestRun` → `synthesizeFromAgentReport` → `renderRun`, sharing every byte of formatting code with the plugin's reporter path.

### `RunEvent` and `RenderState` Effect Schemas in the SDK

`packages/sdk/src/schemas/RunEvent.ts` defines an 11-variant discriminated union covering run lifecycle (`RunStarted`, `RunFinished`), per-module events (`ModuleQueued`, `ModuleStarted`, `ModuleFinished`), per-test events (`TestStarted`, `TestFinished`), coverage events (`CoverageReady`, `ThresholdViolation`), and analysis events (`FailureClassified`, `SuggestedAction`). `packages/sdk/src/schemas/RenderState.ts` defines the denormalized projection the reducer produces and both renderers consume. Both schemas are exported from the SDK root and consumed by `vitest-agent-ui`.

### `githubSummary` option

`AgentPlugin({ githubSummary: boolean })` controls whether the plugin writes a GFM markdown step summary under GitHub Actions. Defaults to `true` when `GITHUB_ACTIONS` is detected. Independent of the `console.ci` slot so users can keep the GHA summary while changing CI stdout behavior.
